# Humanize PPT

Use this skill when a user wants to turn raw material, notes, voice transcripts, documents, links, or old PPTs into a presentation-ready outline before rendering slides.

## Positioning

Humanize PPT is an **Outline Director**, not a slide renderer.

It should run before downstream PPT / HTML slide skills. Its job is to produce a clean AST-based production brief so renderers do not ingest raw noisy material directly.

## AST theory

AST means **Audience-State-Transfer**.

- **Audience**: who is listening, what they know, what they resist, and why they would keep listening.
- **State**: the audience state before and after the deck, plus the core tension that blocks the transition.
- **Transfer**: the slide-by-slide path that moves the audience from initial state to desired state.

Core sentence:

> PPT is not an information container. PPT is an audience state-transfer artifact.

## Required output contract

For every Humanize PPT run, produce:

1. `deck_brief.md` — audience, goal, tension, success criteria.
2. `ast_outline.md` — AST map and narrative arc.
3. `slide_plan.json` — slide-by-slide plan.
4. `speaker_intent.md` — what the speaker should do on each slide.
5. `asset_manifest.md` — screenshots, charts, images, video needs.
6. `video_slots.json` — optional HyperFrames / video insertion plan.

## Recommended OPC workflow

```text
O — Outline Director
  Humanize PPT: raw material → AST outline + production brief

P — Presentation Production
  guizang path: Chinese stable HTML PPT
  Zara path: style exploration and HTML production

C — Complete / Control
  HyperFrames video adapter
  Presenter Adapter shell
  Deploy / export adapter
  QA checklist
```

## Rules

1. Do not let slide renderers consume raw material directly when Humanize PPT can first produce the AST contract.
2. Keep presenter mode as a post-processing adapter, not a style.
3. Separate deployment from presenter mode.
4. Absorb AI-writing cleanup principles from humanizer tools, but do not reduce Humanize PPT to text polishing.
5. Prefer a small verified workflow over a broad unverified promise.
